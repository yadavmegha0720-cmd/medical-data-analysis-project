Medical Data Cleanup and Analysis
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow on a public medical dataset. As a B.Sc. (Hons) Biomedical Sciences student, I am passionate about applying my analytical skills to real-world healthcare challenges. This project focuses on the foundational steps of data analytics, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.

Dataset: The Pima Indians Diabetes Database, a classic dataset used in machine learning and data analysis.

Skills Demonstrated:

Python: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas: For loading, cleaning, and transforming data.

NumPy: Used for numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For creating a clear and informative data visualization.

Problem-Solving: Identifying and handling problematic data points (e.g., zero values in critical columns).

The Analysis Process
Data Loading: I loaded the dataset directly from a public URL using the pandas library.

Data Cleaning: The raw data contained impossible "zero" values in key health metrics. I used a data-driven approach to replace these with the median values for each column, ensuring the integrity of the analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): I calculated key summary statistics to understand the data's distribution and relationships.

Key Findings: I discovered and visualized the distribution of diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients and compared the average BMI between the two groups, showing that the mean BMI is higher for patients with diabetes.

Getting Started
To run this analysis yourself, you can use a Python environment like Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-data-analysis-project.git

Install the necessary libraries: pip install pandas numpy matplotlib

Run the data_analysis.py script.
