# Medical Data Cleanup and Analysis

This project demonstrates a basic data analytics workflow using the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database. The workflow includes loading data, cleaning it, performing statistical analysis, visualizing results, and saving outputs.

## Features

- Loads dataset from a public URL (Kaggle: PIMA Indians Diabetes Database)
- Cleans data by handling missing values and correcting data types
- Performs basic statistical analysis and visualization
- Saves the cleaned dataset and summary report

## Usage

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the analysis**  
   Execute the script:
   ```
   python data_analysis.py
   ```

3. **Outputs**
   - `cleaned_data.csv` — Cleaned dataset
   - `summary_report.txt` — Statistical summary

## Requirements

See `requirements.txt` for required Python packages.

## Dataset Reference

- [PIMA Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database)
